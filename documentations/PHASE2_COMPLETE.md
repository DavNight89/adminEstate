## Overview
Phase 2 adds comprehensive tenant screening capabilities to AdminEstate, allowing property managers to systematically evaluate applicants before approval.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Screening Model** ([Screening.js](../src/models/Screening.js))
Complete data model for tracking all screening activities:

**Features:**

- Employment verification (employer, position, income confirmation)
- Rental history verification (payment history, landlord references)
- Reference checks
- Document review checklist
- Income verification with rent-to-income calculator

**Smart Calculations:**
- `calculateRentToIncomeRatio()` - Automatically checks 3x rent rule
- `calculateOverallScore()` - Risk assessment (0-100 scale)
- `generateRecommendation()` - Auto-suggests approve/conditional/reject
- `suggestConditions()` - Proposes conditions for conditional approvals

---

### 2. **ScreeningChecklist Component** ([ScreeningChecklist.jsx](../src/components/ScreeningChecklist.jsx))

- Real-time screening data persistence

**Workflow Buttons:**
- **Start Screening** - Moves from "submitted" â†’ "screening"
- **Approve** - Moves from "screening" â†’ "approved"
- **Reject** - Moves from "screening" â†’ "rejected"
- **Convert to Tenant** - Creates tenant record from approved application

---

## Complete Workflow

### Application Lifecycle:
```
1. SUBMITTED â†’ 2. SCREENING â†’ 3. APPROVED/REJECTED â†’ 4. TENANT
```

### Detailed Steps:

**Step 1: Application Submitted**
- Applicant fills out 6-step form
- Application saved with "submitted" status
- Appears in ApplicationsList

**Step 2: Start Screening**
- Property manager clicks "Start Screening"
- Status changes to "screening"
- Screening tab becomes active
- ScreeningChecklist initialized

**Step 3: Complete Screening Checks**
Property manager works through 6 sections:
- Income verification (auto-calculates ratio)
- Credit check (enter score, flag issues)
- Background check (clear/flagged/denied)
- Employment verification (confirm employer/income)
- Rental history (contact landlords)
- Document review (verify documents)

**Step 4: Risk Assessment**
System automatically:
- Calculates overall risk score (0-100)
- Generates recommendation (approve/conditional/reject)
- Suggests conditions for conditional approvals
- Shows completion percentage

**Step 5: Decision**
Property manager clicks:
- **Approve** â†’ Status: "approved", ready for tenant conversion
- **Reject** â†’ Status: "rejected", adverse action may be required
- **Conditional** â†’ Status: "conditional", conditions listed

**Step 6: Convert to Tenant** (if approved)
- Click "Convert to Tenant" button
- Creates tenant record with application data
- Sets lease start date
- Updates property occupancy
- Application status: "converted"

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Base Score: 100 (Perfect)

**Penalties:**
- Background flagged: -15 points
- Background denied: -30 points
- Criminal history: -10 points
- Credit score < 580: -30 points
- Credit score 580-620: -20 points
- Credit score 620-660: -10 points
- Collections: -10 points
- Bankruptcies: -15 points
- Evictions: -25 points
- Rent > 33% income: -20 points
- Rent > 40% income: -10 points (additional)
- Paid rent late: -20 points
- Wouldn't rent again: -15 points
- Lease violations: -5 points each

**Bonuses:**
- Employer + income confirmed: +5 points

**Recommendation Thresholds:**
- **75-100**: Approve (strong application)
- **60-74**: Conditional (acceptable with conditions)
- **0-59**: Reject (significant risk factors)

---

## Conditional Approval Conditions

System automatically suggests conditions based on screening results:

**Income Issues:**
- Require co-signer or guarantor
- Increase security deposit by 50%

**Credit Issues (score < 650):**
- Increase security deposit
- Require first and last month rent upfront

**Collections on Record:**
- Provide proof of payment plan or resolution

**Payment History Issues:**
- Require automatic rent payment setup
- Additional security deposit
