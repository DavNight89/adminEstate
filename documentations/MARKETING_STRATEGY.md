### LinkedIn Launch Post:
```
🏠 I spent 6 months building free property management software to replace my $360/year subscription.

Here's why:

When I started managing rental properties, I needed software to:
→ Track tenants and rent payments
→ Screen applicants professionally
→ Manage maintenance requests
→ Analyze portfolio performance

The problem? Every solution charged $30-40/month for basic features.

So I built AdminEstate - completely free, offline-first property management software with:

✅ Tenant screening workflow (6-step application + risk scoring)
✅ Financial tracking & analytics
✅ Work order management
✅ Portfolio insights with ML predictions
✅ 100% data ownership (no vendor lock-in)

Tech stack: React 19, Python/Flask, Pandas, offline-first architecture

It's now open-source and free forever.

Who's this for?
→ Small landlords (1-10 properties)
→ Real estate investors starting out
→ Anyone tired of subscription fees

### Reddit Post (r/realestateinvesting):
```
Title: I built free property management software to replace TenantCloud/Avail [Open Source]

Body:

Hey r/realestateinvesting,

I've been managing a few rental properties for the past 2 years and got tired of paying $30-40/month for basic property management software.

So I spent the last 6 months building my own - and I'm open-sourcing it.

**What it does:**
- Tenant screening (application workflow + background checks)
- Rent/expense tracking
- Maintenance request management
- Portfolio analytics
- Works offline (syncs when online)

**Why it's different:**
- 100% free (no hidden costs)
- You own all your data locally
- No per-unit fees
- Modern UI (React)
- Actually works offline

I built this primarily for myself, but figured other small landlords might find it useful.

It's definitely more technical than the "plug and play" solutions (you need to run it locally), but if you're comfortable with basic tech, it's pretty straightforward.

**GitHub:** [link]
**Demo:** [video link]

Would love feedback from this community - what features am I missing?

(Mods: Let me know if this violates any rules - happy to adjust!)
