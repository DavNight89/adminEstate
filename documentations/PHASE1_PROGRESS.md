- Test online sync when connection restored
- Handle conflicts
- Test with browser DevTools offline mode

---

## üéØ Next Steps

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Create ApplicationDetails component (viewing full application)
2. Create applicationService.js (API integration layer)
3. Integrate applications into main app navigation
4. Test end-to-end flow: submit ‚Üí view ‚Üí approve ‚Üí convert to tenant

**Then:**
5. Add document upload integration
6. Implement basic email notifications
7. Comprehensive offline testing

---

## üîß How to Test Current Progress

### Backend Testing

1. Start Flask backend:
```bash
cd backend-python
python app_simple.py
```

2. Test endpoints with curl or Postman:

**Create Application:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/applications \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "555-1234",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "propertyId": "prop-123",
    "propertyName": "Casa Zai",
    "desiredUnit": "10",
    "desiredMoveInDate": "2025-12-01",
    "leaseTerm": 12,
    "currentEmployer": "Tech Corp",
    "jobTitle": "Engineer",
    "employmentStartDate": "2020-01-01",
    "monthlyIncome": 5000,
    "employerPhone": "555-9999",
    "currentAddress": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Birmingham",
      "state": "AL",
      "zip": "35206"
    },
    "emergencyContact": {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "relationship": "Sister",
      "phone": "555-8888"
    },
    "backgroundCheckConsent": true,
    "creditCheckConsent": true,
    "consentSignature": "John Doe"
  }'
```

**Get All Applications:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/applications
```

**Get Stats:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/applications/stats
```

### Frontend Testing (Once Integrated)

1. Navigate to Applications page
2. Fill out ApplicationForm through all 6 steps
3. Submit application
4. View in ApplicationsList
5. Test search/filter/sort
6. Test status changes

---

## üìä Features Summary

### What Works Now:
‚úÖ Complete multi-step application form (6 steps)
‚úÖ Backend API for CRUD operations
‚úÖ Data validation (frontend and backend)
‚úÖ Application status workflow
‚úÖ Search, filter, sort applications
‚úÖ Convert approved applications to tenants
‚úÖ Statistics dashboard
‚úÖ Offline-ready data structure

### What's Next:
‚è≥ Application detail viewer
‚è≥ Frontend API service layer
‚è≥ Integration into main app
‚è≥ Document uploads
‚è≥ Email notifications
‚è≥ Offline sync testing

---

## üí° Key Design Decisions

1. **Offline-First:** Applications stored in localStorage, synced to data.json via backend
2. **No External APIs:** Phase 1 is entirely self-contained
3. **Status Workflow:** submitted ‚Üí screening ‚Üí approved/rejected ‚Üí (converted to tenant)
4. **Validation:** Both frontend (UX) and backend (security) validation
5. **Modular Components:** Form, List, and Details are separate for maintainability

---

## üéì What This Demonstrates

**For Your Portfolio:**
- Multi-step form with state management
- Full CRUD REST API
- Data validation (Pydantic + JavaScript)
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Complex data models with nested objects
- Search, filter, sort functionality
- Status-based workflows
- Offline-first architecture

**Skills Showcased:**
- React hooks (useState, complex state management)
- Python Flask API development
- Pydantic data validation
- RESTful API design
- Form UX (multi-step, validation, error handling)
- Data modeling
- Business logic implementation

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### Created:
```
src/models/Application.js
src/components/ApplicationForm.jsx
src/components/ApplicationsList.jsx

backend-python/app_simple.py (extended)
```

### Modified:
```

```

### To Create:
```
src/components/ApplicationDetails.jsx
src/services/applicationService.js
```

**Estimated Completion:** Phase 1 is ~70% complete. Remaining work: 2-3 hours.

**Ready for Phase 2:** Once Phase 1 is fully integrated and tested, we can add manual screening workflow (Phase 2).
